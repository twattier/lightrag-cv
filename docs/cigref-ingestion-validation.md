10. Configuration/Change Management (28 occurrences) - System monitoring, maintenance
```

### Relationship Count

**Status**: ✅ PASS (Exceeds requirements)

- Total relationships: 1,989
- Minimum required: 20
- **Achievement**: 9,945% of minimum requirement

### Sample Relationships

```json
[
  ["Information System", "Information Systems Consultant"],
  ["Information Systems Consultant", "Project Owner"],
  ["Business Unit Management", "Information Systems Consultancy"],
  ["Executive Management", "Information Systems Consultancy"],
  ["management-related recommendations", "process"],
  ["assessment and choice of a software package", "process"],
  ["definition of general project specifications", "process"]
]
```

**Relationship Patterns Identified**:
- Job roles → Responsibilities
- Business units → IT functions
- Processes → Activities
- Systems → Consultants/Managers

## Query Test Results

**Test Query**: "What are the skills required for Cloud Architect?"

**Status**: ⏸️ DEFERRED

**Note**: Query test deferred until batch ingestion completes. The system is operational and ready for queries, but comprehensive testing will be performed after full ingestion.

## Validation Queries

### Check Vector Storage

```sql
-- Check total chunk count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lightrag_vdb_chunks WHERE workspace='default';
-- Result: 344 chunks

-- Check CIGREF-specific batches
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lightrag_vdb_chunks
WHERE workspace='default'
  AND file_path LIKE '%cigref_batch%';
-- Result: 344 chunks from CIGREF batches
```

### Check Graph Entities

```sql
-- Check entity count
SELECT SUM(count) FROM lightrag_full_entities WHERE workspace='default';
-- Result: 2,787 entities

-- Sample top entities
SELECT entity_names, count
FROM lightrag_full_entities
WHERE workspace='default'
ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Graph Relationships

```sql
-- Check relationship count
SELECT SUM(count) FROM lightrag_full_relations WHERE workspace='default';
-- Result: 1,989 relationships

-- Sample relationships
SELECT relation_pairs
FROM lightrag_full_relations
WHERE workspace='default'
LIMIT 10;
```

## Overall Status

✅ **VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL (Partial Completion)**

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Vector embeddings: 344 chunks stored with 1024-dimensional embeddings
- ✅ Knowledge graph: 2,787 entities extracted (5,574% of requirement)
- ✅ Relationships: 1,989 connections created (9,945% of requirement)
- ✅ PostgreSQL storage: All LightRAG tables operational
- ⏳ Batch processing: 50.5% complete, ongoing ingestion

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor batch ingestion progress to completion (344/681 chunks)
- Execute query test after full ingestion
- Generate final validation report with 100% metrics
