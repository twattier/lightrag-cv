  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-relevant changes. Config.py maintains safe patterns (env vars via dotenv, no hardcoded secrets)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Zero runtime impact. Directory creation adds ~600 bytes filesystem footprint."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Backward compatible (original scripts/config.py preserved). Safe rollback via git reset."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear modular structure with self-documenting directory names and docstrings. Future-ready for Story 2.5.2 (LLM abstraction)."
