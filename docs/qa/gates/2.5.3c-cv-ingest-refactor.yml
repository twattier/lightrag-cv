# Additional context
code_quality_notes: |
  Outstanding refactoring demonstrating:
  - Clean 4-stage pipeline architecture (download → parse → classify → import)
  - Class-based design: CVParsingStats for comprehensive tracking
  - Proper LLM abstraction: Uses app.shared.llm_client.get_llm_client()
  - Sophisticated prompting: is_latin_text detection distinguishes names from content language
  - PostgreSQL integration: document_metadata table with proper schema
  - Recent enhancement: is_latin_text filtering with tracking counter (lines 260-267)
  - Follows proven CIGREF pattern from Story 2.5.3b
