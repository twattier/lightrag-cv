# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation, file size limits, no path traversal vulnerabilities. No rate limiting/auth is acceptable for POC scope."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async architecture with thread pool executors for CPU-intensive ops. Manual test confirms 154ms processing time for sample DOCX."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, request tracing, structured logging, health check endpoint."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture, 100% coding standards compliance, excellent documentation, testable design."

# Recommendations (all addressed during review)
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues
  future:
    - action: "Consider FastAPI dependency injection pattern for service instance instead of global variable"
      refs: ["services/docling/src/api/routes.py:22-30"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current pattern is acceptable for POC but dependency injection would be more idiomatic FastAPI"
